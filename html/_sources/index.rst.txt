CDEPS documentation
===================

The Community Data Models for Earth Predictive Systems (CDEPS)
contains a set of NUOPC-compliant data components along with
ESMF-based share code that enables new capabilities in selectively
removing feedbacks in coupled model systems.  The CDEPS data
models perform the basic function of reading external data files,
modifying those data, and then sending the data back to the CMEPS
mediator.
