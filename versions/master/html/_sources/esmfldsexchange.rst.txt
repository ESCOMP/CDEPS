API for emsFldsExchange_xxx module
==================================

The application specific module, ``esmFldsExchange_xxx.F90`` contains
all of the information that determines how the mediator performs the
exchange of fields between components. In particular, this module
determines how each sourc field is mapped from their source mesh to
the destinatinon mesh and then then subsequently how a collection of
source fields is merged to the target destination field. This section describes
the API for the calls that determine this information.
